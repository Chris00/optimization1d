(** One dimensional minimization routines. *)

val brent : ?tol:float -> (float -> float) -> float -> float -> float * float
(** [brent f a b] uses Bent's method to return [(x, f x)] where [x] is
    the best approximation to a minimum point of [f] on the interval
    [[a,b]].

    @param tol Default: [sqrt epsilon_float].  The algorithm reduces the
    interval [[a,b]] containing an approximation [x] of the minimum
    until |x - (a+b)/2| + |b-a|/2 <= 2 sqrt epsilon_float |x| + tol / 3.

    mathematical computations. M., Mir, 1980. *)

val golden_search :
  ?tol:float -> (float -> float) -> float -> float -> float -> float * float
(** [golden_search f a b c] returns [(x, f x)] where [x] is an
    approximaion of a minimum point of [f] inside the interval
    [[a,c]].  The point [b] must be between [a] and [c] and such that
    [f(b)] is lower than [f(a)] and [f(c)].

    @param tol Default: [sqrt epsilon_float].  The algorithm reduces the
    interval [[a,c]] until |a - c| <= tol (|a| + |c|). *)
