   Algorithm

   G.Forsythe, M.Malcolm, C.Moler, Computer methods for
   mathematical computations. M., Mir, 1980, p.202 of the Russian
   edition

   The function makes use of the "gold section" procedure combined with
   the parabolic interpolation.
   At every step program operates three abscissae - x,v, and w.

   x - the last and the best approximation to the minimum location,
   i.e. f(x) <= f(a) or/and f(x) <= f(b)
   (if the function f has a local minimum in (a,b), then the both
   conditions are fulfiled after one or two steps).

   v,w are previous approximations to the minimum location. They may
   coincide with a, b, or x (although the algorithm tries to make all
   u, v, and w distinct). Points x, v, and w are used to construct
   interpolating parabola whose minimum will be treated as a new
   approximation to the minimum location if the former falls within
   [a,b] and reduces the range enveloping minimum more efficient than
   the gold section procedure.
